Dear Viewer,

Welcome to "TEAM DEEP-SEA DEFENDERS."

**PROJECT OVERVIEW:**
Our team embarked on a mission for the GDSC Solution Challenge - 2024. Each year, GDSC challenges young individuals to innovate, aligning their creations with the betterment of human civilization. This year, without specific problem statements, our challenge was to innovate based on the "UN-17 Sustainable Goal."

**CHOSEN SUSTAINABLE GOAL:**
From the array of goals, we chose the less spotlighted yet critical "LIFE BELOW WATER." Often, the underwater situation is more dire than it appears. Uncontrollable and hazardous destruction occurs annually, leading to the extinction of many species due to underwater pollution.

**PROJECT APPROACH:**
In response, we present our solution â€“ a web-based application facilitating connections between plastic sellers and buyers to collectively combat "BEACH WATER POLLUTION." We plan to onboard numerous 'PLASTIC BUYER/RECYCLER' users initially. Subsequently, our app will be publicly accessible for anyone, including government or private "PLASTIC BUYER/COLLECTOR," to register through a straightforward authentication process.

Upon joining, users provide personal details such as monthly plastic production and expected rates per kilogram. They also share their location. Our program then scans the database to find the perfect match within a 10-50 km range. To streamline the process further, we've integrated a 'TWO-WAY CHAT-BOT' for seamless communication among users. After finalizing the deal, the sea-dumped plastic becomes reusable.
